        <h1>Welcome to the Website</h1>
        <p>Hey there, welcome to a work in progress. This is the website of KingAL aka Alhaji Sow. Here I will apply my coding
            knowledge and practice web development. This right now is just for me but it would be useful for the future.
            You see... I have one impossible dream that I will sacrafice everything and anything until the day it is acheived
            to complete and see through. I need every advantage I can get. I really enjoy coding and building websites and I am just at the simple stage of it. 
            In fact I just learned how to type because I wanted to be able to code faster and it is really a relief to finally have learned.
            To inform you this is like the fourth time I have started from scratch building this website
            and it gets better every time. However I would like to expand on the others now as I haven't
            even started on them. On the home page I would like to put some of my family and friends and
            definetly uzi on here. I really am glad to be born in a technological advanced time and area. 
            So I can have access to a wonder hole of knowledge and learn all I can. With technology so much
            has been made possible. Other things are still turning up and it feels as if are minds are the limit. 
            Anyway enjoy the website and more is on the way.

            <img src="Images\IMG_0948.JPG" alt="Family Pic"> Composed of seven people, I beleive that my family is an average number. My mother and father, my three siblings,
            and my grandmother. I am fifteen years old, my sister is eleven, my brother is ten and my new baby sister is
            three months. My mother is forty-one years old and my dad is forty-six or forty-seven. I enjoy playing with my
            siblings most in my family. I also enjoy helping my parents and i strive to make them proud. They have given
            me all my ideals even if they dont align with theirs, they are the only people who have the right to claim my
            dreams and claim my acheivments as a result as their own. However my failures also can be claimed and I will
            try my hardest to make sure they never feel that they failed to educate me in life. Even if I fail them I will
            shoulder the blame because it is no doubt my own fault.
