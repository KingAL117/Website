            Home of my website. I will talk about alot and this time this page will not be restarted. Like the others. The youtube tutorials
            will guide me an I hope to intergrate jquery and javascript before I start 10th grade. The things I am passionate
            about will go onto this website and the graphics and Css will get better by the day. This page will give insight
            into my life and etc. Please enjoy.

                <b>My Family</b>
            </h1>
            <p>Composed of seven people, I beleive that my family is an average number. My mother and father, my three siblings,
                and my grandmother. I am fifteen years old, my sister is eleven, my brother is ten and my new baby sister
                is three months. My mother is forty-one years old and my dad is forty-six or forty-seven. I enjoy playing
                with my siblings most in my family. I also enjoy helping my parents and i strive to make them proud. They
                have given me all my ideals even if they dont align with theirs, they are the only people who have the right
                to claim my dreams and claim my acheivments as a result as their own. However my failures also can be claimed
                and I will try my hardest to make sure they never feel that they failed to educate me in life. Even if I
                fail them I will shoulder the blame because it is no doubt my own fault.
